        <h1>UGotGDM</h1>
        <h2>Gestational Diabetes Tracking Made Simple</h2>

        <p>UGotGDM is an iOS app designed to help you track glucose readings and food intake during pregnancy. With a clean interface and powerful features, managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has never been easier.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        <h4>Today View</h4>
        <p>See your day at a glance with four daily glucose readings (fasting, breakfast, lunch, dinner) and a complete food diary. Color-coded visual feedback shows whether your readings are in target range (green) or need attention (red).</p>

        <h4>History View</h4>
        <p>Review past days with a scrollable calendar. Track your progress over time and identify patterns in your glucose levels and diet.</p>

        <h4>Charts & Analytics</h4>
        <p>Premium feature: View interactive charts showing your glucose trends over time. Identify which meals or foods might be affecting your readings.</p>

        <h4>Export Your Data</h4>
        <p>Share your health data with your healthcare provider in multiple formats: plain text, CSV for spreadsheets, or professionally formatted PDF reports. All exports include both glucose readings and food entries for comprehensive tracking.</p>

        <h4>Reminders & Notifications</h4>
        <p>Set customizable reminders for glucose testing times and meal logging. Never miss a reading with gentle notifications throughout the day.</p>

        <h4>Privacy First</h4>
        <p>All your health data stays completely private on your device using CoreData. No cloud sync means your sensitive glucose readings and food entries never leave your phone.</p>

        <h3>Who Is This For?</h3>

        <p><strong>Pregnant individuals</strong> who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and need to track glucose levels daily.</p>

        <p><strong>Healthcare providers</strong> who want their patients to have an easy way to share comprehensive glucose and food logs.</p>

        <p><strong>Anyone</strong> who values privacy and wants health data to stay exclusively on their device.</p>

        <h3>Why UGotGDM?</h3>

        <p>Built with input from individuals who have managed GDM. UGotGDM focuses on the essential features that matter most: easy tracking, clear visual feedback, and simple data export for your healthcare team. No unnecessary complexity, just the tools you need.</p>
