        <h1>Privacy Policy for UGotGDM</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated</strong>: January 2025</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. UGotGDM is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your health data stays completely on your device and is never transmitted to any server or cloud service.</p>

        <h2>What Data UGotGDM Collects</h2>

        <h3>Health Data You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Glucose readings (fasting and post-meal blood sugar levels)</li>
            <li>Food diary entries (meals, snacks, and notes about what you eat)</li>
            <li>Reminder preferences and notification settings</li>
            <li>Target glucose range settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Data</h3>
        <p>UGotGDM does not collect any technical data, usage analytics, or device information. The app operates entirely offline.</p>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>

        <h3>Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>All your health data is stored exclusively on your iPhone using CoreData:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data never leaves your device</li>
            <li>No cloud backup or sync</li>
            <li>No internet connection required</li>
            <li>Protected by your device's security features (Face ID, Touch ID, passcode)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Export Function</h3>
        <p>When you choose to export your data (text, CSV, or PDF), the export is generated locally on your device. You control where and how to share it (email, messages, files, etc.). We never receive or have access to exported data.</p>

        <h2>What Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect any personal identifying information</li>
            <li>We do not track your app usage</li>
            <li>We do not collect device information or analytics</li>
            <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your health data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

        <p><strong>We do not share your data with anyone</strong> because we don't have access to it. Your health information stays exclusively on your device.</p>

        <p>The only time your data leaves your device is when you explicitly choose to export and share it with your healthcare provider or others.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>UGotGDM does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks. The app operates completely independently on your device.</p>

        <h2>Premium Features</h2>

        <p>If you purchase premium features through in-app purchase:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment is processed by Apple through the App Store</li>
            <li>We receive only a notification that a purchase was made</li>
            <li>We do not receive your payment information</li>
            <li>See Apple's privacy policy for how they handle App Store purchases</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>

        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong>: View all your data anytime in the app</li>
            <li><strong>Export</strong>: Export your data in text, CSV, or PDF format</li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Delete individual entries or all data from the Settings</li>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: Data is kept only as long as you choose to keep it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <p>Your data security relies on your device's built-in security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a strong device passcode</li>
            <li>Enable Face ID or Touch ID</li>
            <li>Keep your iOS updated</li>
            <li>If you lose your device, all data is protected by iOS security features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>UGotGDM is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children, and because all data stays on-device, no data is transmitted regardless of user age.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update this page and the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be announced in the app.</p>

        <h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>

        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or UGotGDM's privacy practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email: <a href="mailto:allenruaidhri@gmail.com">allenruaidhri@gmail.com</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transparency</h2>

        <p>This privacy policy is intentionally straightforward because our approach to privacy is simple: your health data is yours alone. We built UGotGDM to help you track gestational diabetes without compromising your privacy.</p>
