    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This is the first post, so i will begin by putting down a few things about myself.</p>
<p>At the time of typing this, I am 43 years old. I feel old as dirt&hellip;</p>
<p>I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons (TTRPG).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played since I was little. I usually DM now. My players are cool because they know the rules better than I do. D&amp;D has gone through so many rule sets over the years that I&rsquo;ve really just gotten bored of learning the rules. I know that annoys people sometimes because, as the DM, I need to make rulings during play. But I prefer to just be the guy who knows where the story is (mostly) going and the guy who controls the monsters. I refer to my players for what the rules are.</p>
<p>I love making music.</p>
<p>I worked in a great music venue when I was flunking out of university (the first time). The vibe was electric and I&rsquo;ve held onto that feeling ever since. Much later, I worked in a recording studio. I could see that the business was failing but I hung around because it was fun. I&rsquo;ve jammed with mates many times and there is no better feeling than when everyone is imporvising and it just comes together. There is a flow state there and its true value cannot be captured in any kind of recording.</p>
<p>I love coding.</p>
<p>I started programming around about 1996 when I got a Casio CFX-9850G graphing calculator in my third year of high school and I discovered it had a little module in its OS where you could write programs in some stripped down version of BASIC. I built all kinds of games on that thing :) I later went to uni to study molecular biology, but I took electives in Java just to satisfy the courses points requirements. Later, I would work for a cool Swiss software company. Even though I was their lowly support manager, it piqued my interest in coding again.</p>
<p>After I left that place I knuckled down and published my first App to the iOS App Store. It combined my love of improvising with my love of solving problems with code. I&rsquo;d go on to publish another App, this time a game. It wasn&rsquo;t an RPG but it was Rad (in fact, it still is)</p>
<p>One thing that I noticed during all my coding endeavours is that, as the project progresses and the codebase gets larger, it also gets more complicated. I realised that this complexity is probably a result of the WAY that I code. Coding is like the proverbial &lsquo;skinning of cats&rsquo; in that there are so many ways to achieve the same end.</p>
<p>So, I thought the best course of action must be to go back to university, but this time I should focus my study on programming. Surely, this would be a great salve for my affliction known widely as Imposter Syndrome. Well, I guess it worked, but not in the way I expected. I thought I would be presented with all this knowledge to level up my coding: deep dives into architectural patterns, application of SOLID principals, version control, testing, CI, deployment&hellip; nope. It definitely solidified my existing knowledge, and we did explore a few peripheral topics that are essential for Software dev professionals (eg, system analysis, academic UX concepts, project management, ethics&hellip;). But ultimately it just made me feel like I was just being dumb by thinking that I was not ready to be a professional. Really just a very expensive ego-boost. All the same, I&rsquo;m glad I did it because now I know.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve evolved further. I&rsquo;m trying to capture the knowledge domains that I have felt inadequate in for so long. I have read multiple books on testing Swift, and Swift design patterns, and I&rsquo;m enrolled in the complete senior developers course run by the crew at essential developer. I want a senior developer role, and frankly I don&rsquo;t care if I get one with a cool company, or if I simply perform at that level in my current endeavours as an idepenedant developer.</p>
<p>This blog will document my study and work as I continue down this path to becoming a great programmer. I&rsquo;ve come a long way, but I know I have much yet to learn.</p>
