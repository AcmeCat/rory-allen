### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I unlock new ships?
Complete missions and collect resources. Each vessel has specific unlock requirements visible in the Ships menu.

#### What do artefacts do?
Artefacts provide passive bonuses like increased damage, shield regeneration, or special abilities. Equip up to 3 at once in the Loadout menu.

#### How do I restore my purchases?
Go to Settings > Restore Purchases. You must be signed in with the same Apple ID used to make the original purchase.

#### Why can't I beat a boss?
Each boss has patterns you need to learn. Try Boss Rush mode to practice. Focus on dodging first, then find safe windows to attack.

Sign in to Game Center in your iOS settings. Leaderboards will appear automatically in the Stats menu.

#### Can I play offline?
Yes! Antsteroids works fully offline. Leaderboard syncing requires an internet connection.
