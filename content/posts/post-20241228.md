I'm sure I would have started with something like...

```
codecurrentIndex += 1

if(currentIndex == myList.count) {
    currentIndex = 0
 }
 ```
...then perhaps later I would try to make it a one-liner but sadly introduce complexity...
```
currentIndex = currentIndex < myList.count - 1 ? currentIndex + 1 : 0
```
But, I'm not sure why I have never come across this before:
```
currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % myList.count
```
When I first saw it I knew immediately what it did, yet I've never even thought of using the modulus when incrementing an index value. wild
