I'm nearly certain that learning this technique is a total game-changer for your ability to produce well architected code. I knew I needed it a long time ago, but I just didn't know what it was. I've been searching for ways to organise my code so that I stop hitting *'brick walls of complexity'*. I always get to a point where I need to abandon a personal project because managing dependancies is becoming too cumbersome, and I know there has to be a better way.

I remember the first time I heard the term *'Dependancy Injection'*. It sounded like some highly complex process that I would do well to avoid in my coding adolescence. It wasn't until much later that I found out I had been doing it for years without knowing. Later still, I read the following quote by James Shore:

> *'Dependency Injection'* is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept.
```
class MusicPlayer {
    func play() {
        let song = Playlist.shared.nextSong() // Hidden dependency on `Playlist.shared`
        print("Now playing: \(song)")
    }
}

class Playlist {
    static let shared = Playlist()
    private var songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]
    private var currentIndex = 0
    
    func nextSong() -> String {
        let song = songs[currentIndex]
        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % songs.count
        return song
    }
}
````
#### Issues with the Code
- *Tight Coupling:* **MusicPlayer** is tightly coupled to the singleton **Playlist.shared**.
- *Hidden Dependencies:* The dependency on **Playlist** is implicit, making it hard to test **MusicPlayer** in isolation.
- *Global State:* **Playlist.shared** introduces mutable global state, which can lead to unexpected bugs.

#### Step 1: Introduce Dependency Injection
Make the dependency on **Playlist** explicit by injecting it into the **MusicPlayer**:
```
class MusicPlayer {
    private let playlist: Playlist
    
    init(playlist: Playlist) {
        self.playlist = playlist
    }
    
    func play() {
        let song = playlist.nextSong()
        print("Now playing: \(song)")
    }
}
```
The **Playlist** now needs to be passed to **MusicPlayer** during initialization:
```
class Playlist {
    private var songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]
    private var currentIndex = 0
    
    func nextSong() -> String {
        let song = songs[currentIndex]
        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % songs.count
        return song
    }
}

// Usage
let playlist = Playlist()
let musicPlayer = MusicPlayer(playlist: playlist)
musicPlayer.play()
```
Benefits:
- **MusicPlayer** is no longer coupled to the singleton **Playlist.shared**.
- Dependencies are explicit and testable.
#### Step 2: Apply the Interface Segregation Principle
Extract a protocol for **Playlist** to implement so that **MusicPlayer** depends on an abstraction, not a concrete implementation.
```
protocol PlaylistProvider {
    func nextSong() -> String
}

class Playlist: PlaylistProvider {
    private var songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]
    private var currentIndex = 0
    
    func nextSong() -> String {
        let song = songs[currentIndex]
        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % songs.count
        return song
    }
}

class MusicPlayer {
    private let playlist: PlaylistProvider
    
    init(playlist: PlaylistProvider) {
        self.playlist = playlist
    }
    
    func play() {
        let song = playlist.nextSong()
        print("Now playing: \(song)")
    }
}

// Usage
let playlist = Playlist()
let musicPlayer = MusicPlayer(playlist: playlist)
musicPlayer.play()
```
Benefits:
- **MusicPlayer** depends only on the **PlaylistProvider** abstraction, making it more flexible.
- You can now easily substitute **Playlist** with a mock implementation for testing.
#### Step 3: Use Inversion of Control (IoC)
Use an IoC container or factory to manage object creation, so your **MusicPlayer** doesn’t need to know how to create its dependencies. Here's a simplified manual IoC:
```
class MusicApp {
    static func createMusicPlayer() -> MusicPlayer {
        let playlist = Playlist()
        return MusicPlayer(playlist: playlist)
    }
}

// Usage
let musicPlayer = MusicApp.createMusicPlayer()
musicPlayer.play()
```
#### Step 4: Add Dependency Inversion
In a more complex system, the **MusicPlayer** might need additional services, such as a **SongFetcher** that retrieves songs from a network or database. Let's see how to decouple further:
1. Create an abstraction for fetching songs:
```
protocol SongFetcher {
    func fetchNextSong() -> String
}
```
2. Implement a concrete **SongFetcher**:
```
class NetworkSongFetcher: SongFetcher {
    func fetchNextSong() -> String {
        // Pretend to fetch from a network
        return "Song from the cloud"
    }
}
```
3. Update **MusicPlayer** to depend on the **SongFetcher**:
```
class MusicPlayer {
    private let songFetcher: SongFetcher
    
    init(songFetcher: SongFetcher) {
        self.songFetcher = songFetcher
    }
    
    func play() {
        let song = songFetcher.fetchNextSong()
        print("Now playing: \(song)")\
    }\
}

// Usage
let songFetcher = NetworkSongFetcher()
let musicPlayer = MusicPlayer(songFetcher: songFetcher)
musicPlayer.play()
```
Benefits:
- **MusicPlayer** doesn’t care whether the songs come from a playlist, a network, or any other source. It simply relies on the **SongFetcher** abstraction.
