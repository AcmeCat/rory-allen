### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I set up my budget?
On first launch, enter your weekly budget amount and create categories. You can always adjust these later in Settings.

#### Can I change my weekly budget amount?
Yes! Go to Settings > Edit Weekly Budget and enter your new amount.

#### What happens to my data if I delete the app?
Since Bujt stores data locally, deleting the app will delete all your budget data. Back up using the Export feature first if you want to keep your records.

#### Can I sync between devices?
No, Bujt intentionally doesn't sync between devices to protect your privacy. Your data stays completely local to ensure maximum security.

#### How do I backup my data?
You can export your data as CSV from Settings > Export Data. This file stays on your device and can be saved to Files or shared via email.

#### Can I import data from other budgeting apps?
Currently, Bujt doesn't support importing from other apps. This is a feature we may add in future updates.

#### When does my budget reset?
By default, budgets reset weekly on Sunday. You can change this in Settings > Budget Week Starts On.

#### Can I track multiple budgets?
Bujt is designed for a single weekly budget. However, you can use categories to separate different types of spending.

### Common Issues

#### Expenses Not Saving
1. Ensure you've created at least one category
2. Check that the amount is a valid number
3. Verify storage space on your device isn't full
4. Restart the app

#### Budget Not Resetting
1. Check Settings > Budget Week Starts On
2. Verify your device date/time is correct
3. Try manual reset in Settings > Reset Current Week

#### Can't Delete a Category
Categories with expenses can't be deleted. Archive them instead by setting their budget to 0, or move expenses to another category first.

#### Lost Data After iOS Update
Check if you have an iCloud or iTunes backup from before the update. Restore your device from backup to recover data.

### Data Recovery

#### Recovering Lost Data
If you've lost data:
1. Check if you have a recent iOS backup (iCloud or iTunes)
2. Check if you exported data recently (CSV file)
3. If neither option is available, data cannot be recovered

#### Preventing Data Loss
- Export your data regularly (Settings > Export Data)
- Enable iCloud Backup for your device
- Don't delete the app unless you've exported data
