# Privacy Policy for Bujt

**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Overview

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This privacy policy explains how Bujt ("the App") handles your information.

## Our Privacy Commitment

**Bujt does not collect, transmit, or store your financial data on any external servers.** All your budget information stays completely private on your device.

## Information Storage

### Local Storage Only
All data is stored locally on your device using CoreData:
- Budget amounts and categories
- Expense records
- Spending history
- App settings and preferences

### No Cloud Sync
Unlike other budgeting apps, Bujt intentionally does not sync to the cloud. This means:
- Complete privacyâ€”your spending data never leaves your device
- No account creation required
- No server-side storage
- No risk of data breaches from external servers

## Data We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
- Your financial data
- Bank account information
- Credit card numbers
- Transaction details
- Personal identification
- Location data
- Contact information

## Automatically Collected Data

### Minimal Analytics (Optional)
If you choose to enable analytics in Settings:
- Device type (e.g., iPhone 12)
- iOS version
- App version
- Crash reports (no personal data included)

This data is completely anonymous and helps us improve the app. You can opt out at any time in Settings > Privacy.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

Your financial information:
- Stays on your device
- Is never transmitted over the internet
- Is never sold or shared with third parties
- Is never used for advertising

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: View all your data within the app
- **Delete**: Clear all data in Settings > Reset Data
- **Export**: Export your data as CSV from Settings (stays on your device)
- **Opt Out**: Disable analytics in Settings > Privacy

## Backups

If you use iCloud or iTunes backup for your device, your Bujt data will be included in those backups. This is controlled by iOS, not by Bujt. You can manage iOS backups in your device Settings.

## Security

Since all data is stored locally:
- Your data is protected by your device's passcode/biometric security
- No internet transmission means no interception risk
- iOS provides encryption for app data

## Third-Party Services

Bujt uses minimal third-party services:
- **Apple Analytics** (optional): For anonymous crash reports and usage statistics
- No advertising networks
- No social media trackers
- No analytics companies

## Children's Privacy

Bujt does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app can be used by all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the app.
