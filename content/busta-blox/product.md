# Busta Blox

## Pong… for One… but Weirder

Busta Blox takes the simple joy of hitting a tennis ball against a wall and fuses it with classic brick-breaking arcade action. The result? A unique single-player experience packed with challenges, power-ups, and plenty of weirdness.

### Key Features

#### Unique Gameplay Fusion
Imagine playing Pong by yourself with a tennis racket against a wall, then add Space Invaders-style enemies and power-ups. That's Busta Blox—a fresh take on arcade classics.

#### Power-Ups and Complications
Collect helpful power-ups that boost your abilities, but watch out for complications that make things harder. Some help, some hinder, and they all keep you on your toes.

#### Progressive Difficulty
Start simple and face increasingly challenging levels. New block types, faster balls, and trickier layouts will test your reflexes and strategy.

#### Retro Aesthetic
Enjoy pixel art graphics created with Pixen and a retro vibe that pays homage to classic arcade games.

#### Original Audio
Experience custom sound effects and music created with Reason that enhance the arcade atmosphere.

### Gameplay

Use your paddle to break blocks, destroy enemies, and survive as long as possible. Timing and positioning are everything—one wrong move and it's game over.

### Power-Up System

**Helpful**:
- Multi-Ball: Launch multiple balls at once
- Paddle Extend: Bigger paddle, easier hits
- Slow Motion: Give yourself time to react
- Shield: Protect against missed balls

**Complications**:
- Paddle Shrink: Harder to hit the ball
- Speed Up: Faster ball movement
- Gravity Shift: Physics go sideways (literally)
- Invisible Ball: Can you hit what you can't see?

### Why Busta Blox?

Born from nostalgia and a desire to create something fresh from familiar mechanics, Busta Blox offers arcade fun with a modern twist. It's currently in development—stay tuned for its App Store release!
