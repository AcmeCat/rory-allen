Need assistance with Busta Blox? We're here to help!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I control the paddle?
Drag your finger left and right anywhere on the screen. The paddle will follow your finger's horizontal movement.

#### What's the difference between power-ups and complications?
Power-ups help you (indicated by bright colors), while complications make the game harder (indicated by warning colors). Learn to recognize them!

#### How do I pause the game?
Tap the pause button in the top corner, or simply lift your finger—the ball won't drop while you're not touching the screen.

#### Can I restart a level?
Yes! Pause the game and select "Restart Level" from the menu.

#### How do high scores work?
Your top scores are saved locally and can be uploaded to Game Center leaderboards if you're signed in.

#### When will the game be released?
Busta Blox is currently in development. Follow for updates on the release date!

### Common Issues

#### Paddle Is Laggy or Unresponsive
1. Ensure your screen is clean
2. Close background apps
3. Remove thick screen protectors if present
4. Check if iOS needs updates

#### Can't See the Ball
This might be the Invisible Ball complication! Wait for it to wear off, or try to track it by sound and paddle hits.

#### Game Is Too Difficult
Start with earlier levels to build skills. Each level teaches different mechanics. Don't rush—practice makes perfect!

#### Lost My Progress
Progress is saved locally. If you deleted and reinstalled the app, progress cannot be recovered. Use iCloud backup to protect your data.
