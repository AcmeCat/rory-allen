## Troubleshooting

Collect the Slow-Mo power-up or practice tracking the ball's trajectory before it reaches your paddle.

### Can't Hit the Ball
Position yourself early based on where the ball is heading, not where it currently is.

### Too Many Complications
Complications are temporary. Survive until they wear off, and avoid collecting suspicious power-ups.
