## Pong… for one… but weirder
###  A simple, no-nonsense budgeting app designed to help you track your spending.

#### Features
I wanted to make a game that was kinda like when yr a kid and you hit a tennis ball against a wall with whatever you can find to swing at it. I fused that idea with something like invaders, et voila, Busta Blox was born. I added a heap of complications, some helpful, some a hinderance, and it ended up a pretty fun game. Hopefully you will find it in the iOS App Store one day (it’s still a work in progress)

#### Tech
*Foundation*, *SpriteKit*, *AVKit*, *Reason*, *Pixen*

#### Check it out
