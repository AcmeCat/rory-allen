        <p>I'm sure I would have started with something like...</p>

        <pre><code>currentIndex += 1

if(currentIndex == myList.count) {
    currentIndex = 0
}</code></pre>

        <p>...then perhaps later I would try to make it a one-liner but sadly introduce complexity...</p>

        <pre><code>currentIndex = currentIndex < myList.count - 1 ? currentIndex + 1 : 0</code></pre>

        <p>But, I'm not sure why I have never come across this before:</p>

        <pre><code>currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % myList.count</code></pre>

        <p>When I first saw it I knew immediately what it did, yet I've never even thought of using the modulus when incrementing an index value. wild</p>
